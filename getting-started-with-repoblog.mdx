# Getting Started with RepoBlog

RepoBlog is a modern blogging platform that lets you write your content in MDX files stored in a separate GitHub repository. This separation of content and code makes it easy to manage, version control, and collaborate on your blog posts.

## What You'll Need

- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account (free tier works great)
- Basic familiarity with Git and command line
- Node.js installed on your local machine

## Step 1: Fork the RepoBlog Repository

First, you'll need your own copy of the RepoBlog codebase:

1. Go to the [RepoBlog repository](https://github.com/your-username/repoblog)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Wait for GitHub to create your fork

This gives you complete control over the codebase and allows you to customize it to your needs.

## Step 2: Create Your Content Repository

Your blog content will live in a separate repository, which keeps your posts organized and makes it easy to manage:

1. Go to GitHub and click **New repository**
2. Name it something like `repoblog-content` or `blog-posts`
3. Make it **public** (so Vercel can access it without authentication)
4. Initialize with a README if you'd like
5. Create your repository

### Add Your First Post

In your content repository, create MDX files for your blog posts. Each file should have frontmatter metadata:

```mdx
---
title: "My First Post"
description: "This is my first blog post using RepoBlog"
date: "2026-02-03"
tags: ["introduction", "blog"]
---

# Welcome to My Blog

This is the content of my first post. You can use **Markdown** formatting,
and even include React components!
```

## Step 3: Set Up Locally (Optional)

If you want to preview your blog locally before deploying:

1. Clone your forked repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repoblog.git
cd repoblog
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your content repository details:
```env
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-username
CONTENT_REPO=repoblog-content
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

Now for the exciting part - deploying your blog to the web!

### Connect Your Repository

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click **Add New Project**
3. Import your forked RepoBlog repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

### Configure Environment Variables

Before deploying, add the environment variables that tell RepoBlog where to find your content:

1. In the project configuration, find **Environment Variables**
2. Add the following variables:
   - `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username
   - `CONTENT_REPO`: Your content repository name (e.g., `repoblog-content`)
   - `GITHUB_BRANCH`: The branch to pull content from (usually `main`)
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional): A personal access token if your content repo is private

3. Click **Deploy**

### Wait for Deployment

Vercel will build and deploy your site. This usually takes 1-3 minutes. Once complete, you'll get a URL like `your-project.vercel.app`.

## Step 5: Update Your Content

The beauty of RepoBlog is how easy it is to publish new content:

1. Add or edit MDX files in your content repository
2. Commit and push your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new blog post"
git push
```

3. Vercel automatically detects changes and redeploys your blog
4. Your new content is live in minutes!

## Customization Tips

### Custom Domain

In your Vercel project settings, you can add a custom domain:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Domains**
2. Add your domain name
3. Update your DNS records as instructed
4. Vercel handles SSL certificates automatically

### Styling and Layout

Fork and modify the RepoBlog codebase to:
- Update colors and fonts in your CSS/Tailwind config
- Modify layout components
- Add your own logo and branding
- Customize the homepage and about page

### Content Organization

In your content repository, you can:
- Use folders to organize posts by category
- Add images in an `images/` folder
- Create draft posts by prefixing filenames with `draft-`
- Use consistent naming conventions like `yyyy-mm-dd-post-title.mdx`

## Automatic Redeployment

RepoBlog can automatically redeploy when you update your content repository:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to **Git** > **Deploy Hooks**
3. Create a new deploy hook
4. In your content repository, add this as a webhook:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Webhooks**
   - Add webhook with the Vercel deploy hook URL
   - Set it to trigger on push events

Now every time you push to your content repo, your blog automatically updates!

## Best Practices

- **Write in drafts first**: Create posts locally and preview them before pushing
- **Use meaningful commit messages**: Makes it easy to track content changes
- **Tag your posts**: Helps readers find related content
- **Include descriptions**: Improves SEO and social media previews
- **Back up your content**: Your Git repository IS your backup, but consider additional backups for images

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Showing Up

- Check environment variables are correct in Vercel
- Verify your content repository is public or you've added a GitHub token
- Ensure MDX files have proper frontmatter
- Check Vercel build logs for errors

### Build Failures

- Review the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check for MDX syntax errors in your posts
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Styling Issues

- Clear your browser cache
- Check CSS/Tailwind configuration
- Review component imports in MDX files

## Next Steps

Now that your blog is live:

1. Write more content!
2. Share your posts on social media
3. Join the RepoBlog community
4. Contribute improvements back to the project
5. Customize the design to match your personal brand

Happy blogging! 🚀
